# Simple Perl Image File Indexing
> Find Latest Image Files by Camera and Filename

This is just a couple of simple Perl scripts to assist managing digital image files the way I've become accustomed.
These have been submitted mostly as a Git and GitHub practice exercise.

## Installing / Getting started

These require that the very excellent  ExifTool image file utility from Phil Harvey be installed.
These require that the Perl Tkx modules be available.
